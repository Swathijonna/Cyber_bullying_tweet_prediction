## Cyber Bullying tweet prediction
## Introduction
Hello there! Welcome to the Cyber Bullying Detection project, where we explore the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to address the growing concern of cyberbullying.

## Objective
Goal of this project is to leverage NLP and machine learning algorithms to classify different types of cyberbullying in social media posts. We aim to convert text into vectorized representations using count vectorizer and classify cyberbullying types using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## Dataset
Gathered data reflecting the exponential growth in internet users and the surge in social media usage, particularly during the pandemic. The dataset highlights the challenges posed by cyberbullying, with alarming statistics leading to severe consequences like suicides, academic performance decline, and depression.

 ## Technologies Used
We've harnessed the power of technologies like NLP, SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Python libraries such as scikit-learn to implement and analyze the project.

## Project Features
Implementation of the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for multi-classification of cyberbullying types.
Use of n-gram and bi-gram analysis to enhance text processing.
Application of TFIDF vectorizer for feature extraction.
## Implementation
The entire project is implemented in Python using the PyCharm IDE, with a focus on utilizing scikit-learn for machine learning model creation. For data visualization, we rely on seaborn and matplotlib.

## Model Evaluation
Thoroughly evaluated our models, conducting a comparative analysis of algorithms. Notably, Support Vector Machine achieved an impressive 84% accuracy on the test dataset, outperforming Multinomial Naive Bayes in precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.

## Results
Our results indicate that logistic regression outperformed Multinomial Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms.Achieved high scores in categories like age and gender, with the least scores observed in religion and other cyberbullying categories.

Happy coding!
